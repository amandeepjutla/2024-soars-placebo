# Predictors of placebo response in SOARS-B: analytic code

This repository contains a notebook that will reproduce the analyses reported in our paper ["Predictors of placebo response in the Study of Oxytocin in Autism to Improve Reciprocal Social Behaviors"](https://doi.org/10.1089/cap.2024.0131). It assumes the raw SOARS data (available from the NIMH Data Archive in SAS format) are in `./data/raw`.
